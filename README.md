## my-fAIve-minutes-app

**A project where every code commit is crafted and committed in 5 minutes or less!** ‚è±Ô∏è

This repository is a fun experiment in rapid development and quick decision-making, leveraging AI tools and techniques. The goal is to build a simple application, whatever it may be, with the constraint that each commit **must be completed within a 5-minute timeframe**.

**Why?**

*   **Embrace Constraints:** Constraints breed creativity and force focus.
*   **Iterative & Agile on Steroids:** See how a project evolves with ultra-short iterations.
*   **Learn to Prioritize:** Deciding what *needs* to be done in 5 minutes is a valuable skill, especially when using AI.
*   **Document the Journey:** The commit history itself becomes a testament to the process.
*   **Explore AI in Short Bursts:** Discover how effectively we can integrate AI models, APIs, or libraries in limited time.

**What is it?**

The application itself is yet to be defined! It will emerge from the series of 5-minute commits, potentially using AI for tasks like data processing, content generation, or model integration.

**How to Contribute?**

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Identify a small, manageable task you can complete in 5 minutes, ideally involving some AI component.** Examples: "Prompted an AI model for initial text and added it to a file," "Used an AI code assistant to generate a simple function," "Integrated a basic AI API endpoint."
3.  **Code!**
4.  **Commit your changes with a descriptive message explaining what you did in those 5 minutes.** (e.g., "Generated initial project description using a GPT model in 5 minutes").
5.  **Push your changes and create a pull request.**

**Rules:**

*   **Time Limit:** No single commit can take longer than 5 minutes to write and commit.
*   **Be Honest:** Don't cheat the time! If you need longer, break the task down further.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Focus on small, incremental changes.
*   **Have Fun!** This is an experiment, so don't take it too seriously.

**Let's see what AI-powered creation we can achieve, 5 minutes at a time!** üöÄ
